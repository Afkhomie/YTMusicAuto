This is YTMusicAuto, A small tool that just finds the "Play All" button on YouTube Music's Quick Pick's section.

# What it does?

- It has the features for checking whether the button is "Play All" button or not.
- It scrolls automatically for finding the "Play All" button.
- It also has a system of making log in "YTMusicLog.txt" file which makes finding of bugs more efficient and       easier.

# How to use it?

2. Open "YTMusicAuto.exe".  
3. Sit back, and enjoy when the program opens your default browser and goes to YTMusic for clicking on "Play     All" button from Quick Pick's section.
4. If the program has any bugs (which it shouldn't) then you can peek at the log file for finding bugs.

NOTE: If there is any bug in the program then please leave some feedback in my Github.

# Things to know:

- Don’t delete the `assets` folder, Otherwise the program will break. "common sense :)"
- It's just a simple program by me.
- There’s source code too, So if interested then please tweak with the source code and have fun but dont forget    to give credits for original copyright.

Lastly, Just have fun! let the computer do some (a tiny bit) of work.
